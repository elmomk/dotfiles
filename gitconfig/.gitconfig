# --- Other Global Settings (that you want to apply after any conditional overrides) ---
# If a setting here conflicts with a conditional setting above, the conditional setting
# (because it's declared after the default, and before any other global sections) will win
# UNLESS another global section below this [includeIf] block re-declares the same setting.
# For simplicity, it's often best to put true "global defaults" at the top, and
# then let the `includeIf` blocks override them.
